## Overview

This avatar gimmick casts high-resolution shadows in real time with a relatively low load. 

Shadows are cast on various parts of the avatar, such as the forelock, chin, and chest, giving the avatar an overwhelming sense of three-dimensionality and presence. 



The system is set up to suppress the influence of world lights and mainly illuminate the lights that follow the avatar, so it does not depend on world lights and therefore does not go completely dark in certain worlds. 



There are two ways to use this system, depending on whether or not paid assets are used. 

(1) NGSS version: <br/>Shadow softness, distance attenuation, etc. can be finely adjusted. 

The following assets are used:<br/> [Next-Gen Soft-Shadows]. https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/next-gen-soft-shadows-137380?locale=ja-JP 

(2) SimplePCSS version: <br/>This version does not require the purchase of additional assets, but is a simple version with only soft shadows and a mask function.
